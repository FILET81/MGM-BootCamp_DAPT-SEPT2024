While a phone book is certainly a ubiquitous and frequently used database, it suffers from the following:\n","\n","- Finding a person's phone number can be time consuming, especially if the phone book contains a large number of entries.\n","\n","- The phone book is indexed only by surnames and first names, so finding the names of people who live at a given address, while possible in theory, is not a practical use for this database.\n","\n","- From the time the phone book is printed, the information becomes less and less accurate as people move in or out of a region, change their phone number, or move to another location within the same region.\n","\n","The same drawbacks that are attributed to telephone directories can be applied to any manual data storage system, such as patient records stored in a filing cabinet. Due to the cumbersome nature of paper databases, some of the first computer applications developed were database systems, which are computerized data storage and retrieval mechanisms. Because a database system stores data electronically instead of on paper, a database system is able to retrieve data faster, index data in multiple ways, and provide up-to-date information to its user community.\n","\n","Early database systems managed data stored on magnetic tape. Since there were typically many more tapes than tape readers, technicians were tasked with loading and unloading tapes as specific data was requested. Since computers at the time had very little memory, multiple requests for the same data often required the data to be read from tape multiple times. Although these database systems were a significant improvement over paper databases, they are a far cry from what is possible with current technology. (Modern database systems can handle petabytes of data, accessed by clusters of servers that each store tens of gigabytes of that data in high-speed memory, but I'm getting a little ahead of myself.)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fM-QMeXm5ZqY"},"source":["## Different tools for different purposes\n","\n","- ETL: SQL, MongoDB; APIs, web-scrapping, Python\n","- Querying: SQL, Python\n","- Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly & Tableau\n","- Machine Learning: Python\n","\n","Recommended reading: [Before the Advent of Database Systems](https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/chapter/chapter-1-before-the-advent-of-database-systems/\n","\n","### Well knwon outages\n","\n","**AWS outage**\n","\n","- [Nichols, S.

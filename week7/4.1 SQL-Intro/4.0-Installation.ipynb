    "SQL, T-SQL y PSQL son lenguajes relacionados con bases de datos que tienen algunas diferencias clave. A continuación, se explican brevemente:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL (Structured Query Language):\n",
    "SQL es el lenguaje estándar utilizado para interactuar con los sistemas de gestión de bases de datos relacionales (RDBMS). Es un lenguaje declarativo que se utiliza para definir, manipular y administrar datos en una base de datos relacional. SQL proporciona comandos para realizar operaciones como consultas, inserciones, actualizaciones, eliminaciones y administración de esquemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T-SQL (Transact-SQL):\n",
    "T-SQL es una extensión propietaria del lenguaje SQL utilizado por Microsoft SQL Server y Sybase. T-SQL incluye las capacidades básicas de SQL y agrega extensiones específicas del sistema. Proporciona características adicionales como el manejo de excepciones, transacciones, cursores, funciones definidas por el usuario y procedimientos almacenados.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. PSQL (Procedural SQL):\n",
    "PSQL es un lenguaje utilizado por el sistema de gestión de bases de datos PostgreSQL. A diferencia de SQL estándar, PSQL permite la programación procedural dentro de las consultas SQL. PSQL admite bucles, condiciones, variables y construcciones de control de flujo, lo que permite una mayor flexibilidad en el procesamiento de datos y la lógica empresarial directamente en las consultas.\n",
    "\n",
    "En resumen, SQL es el lenguaje estándar utilizado para interactuar con bases de datos relacionales, mientras que T-SQL y PSQL son extensiones específicas de SQL utilizadas en los sistemas de gestión de bases de datos Microsoft SQL Server y PostgreSQL, respectivamente. T-SQL agrega características adicionales específicas del sistema, y PSQL permite la programación procedural dentro de las consultas SQL.\n"

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a programming language developed to create, maintain and query structured databases (SQL). There are several types or \"flavors\" of SQL: MySQL, ORACLE_SQL, SQL-Server, or PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them have pretty similar syntax, although there are some minor differences for some specific commands. In this bootcamp, we will be using MySQL as it is one of the most used \"flavors\", and it's \"open source\". Given the fact that the differences between flavors are limited, getting a solid background in MySQL will allow you to switch easily to any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use SQL on your computer, you will need two elements: \n",
    "- the \"server\" and \n",
    "- the \"manager\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The server is used to create databases on your computer. However, as such, is not enough to \"interact\" with it in a \"user-friendly way\". You will need a \"user interface\" to be able to perform CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete databases (and tables, of which databases a built of).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, we are going to use [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) will be used for the server. \n",

    "\n",
    "The installation process depends heavily on your operating system. At the time of writing this document (October 2022), the Windows installer will allow installing the \"server\" and the \"manager\" at the same time. However, the process takes longer time and it's more complex. \n",

    "Once you finish installing the \"manager\", you will need to set up a \"connection\". Open the application MySQL Workbench. You should see a window like [this](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_1.png) (without the \"Ironhack\" box, which is the \"connection\"). \n",

    "To create a connection, click on the \"+\" sign right after the \"MySQL Connections\" [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_2.png). Then a new window will pop up called \"Setup New Connection\" [like this](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_3.png). Now, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the \"Connection Name\" [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_4.png) box input \"Ironhack\". \n",
    "2. In the \"Username\" box [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_5.png) replace \"root\" with the \"user\" you input during the \"engine\" installation process (if you weren't asked to provide a \"username\" during the installation process, go to the next step). \n",
    "3. Finally in the \"Password\" box, click on \"Store in Keychain\" [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_6.png) and provide the password you set during the \"engine\" installation process. \n",
    "4. Finally click on \"Test connection\" [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_7.png). You should get a response of successful connection being established.\n",
    "5. Click on \"Ok\" [see here](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_8.png).\n",

    "## Testing the new connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the main menu, you can \"double click\" on the \"Ironhack box\" and you should end with a very similar screen to [this one](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/prework/images/mysql_setup_new_connection_9.png). In the left panel you should be able to find two tabs:\n",

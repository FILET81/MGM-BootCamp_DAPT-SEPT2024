-- 		Logical order of processing
-- ----------------------------------------
/*
Even though if someone would read the SQL query, 
it is likely that they would think that the query 
is processed line after line from the beginning. 
But the way SQL reads the query is different:

1. FROM
2. ON
3. JOIN
4. WHERE
5. GROUP BY
6. WITH CUBE/ROLLUP
7. HAVING
8. SELECT
9. DISTINCT
10. ORDER BY
11. TOP/LIMIT
12. OFFSET/FETCH

Ejemplo: 

5 SELECT 5.2 DISTINCT 7 TOP 
    5.1 
1 FROM 
2 WHERE 
3 GROUP BY 
4 HAVING 
6 ORDER BY 
7 OFFSET  FETCH

-- 				NULL Values
-- ----------------------------------------
/*
A common mistake that people make is to use the term NULL value 
but a NULL is not a value; rather, itâ€™s a mark for a missing value. 
So the correct terminology is either NULL mark or just NULL. 
Also, because SQL uses only one mark for missing values, 
when you use a NULL, there is no way for SQL to know whether 
it is supposed to represent a missing and applicable case or 
a missing and inapplicable case.
*/

-- 0 means not null, 1 means null

where k_symbol is null;

select * from bank.order;

/*As you might have noticed in this case, 
even though we see a lot of missing values in the column k_symbol, 
the above query does not filter those rows. 
It might be because those columns actually have value, 
for example, empty space. 
SQL considers that as a character/ value as well. 
So we will check for that now:
*/

select count(*) from bank.order
where k_symbol is not null and k_symbol = ' ';

/*				ACTIVITY
1. Null or empty values are usually a problem. 
   Think about why those null values can appear and think of ways of dealing with them.

2. Check for transactions with null or empty values for the column amount.

3. Count how many transactions have empty and non-empty k_symbol (in one query).
*/

/*
The possible values of a predicate in SQL are TRUE, FALSE and UNKNOWN. 
This is referred to as three-valued logic and is unique to SQL. 
Logical expressions in most programming languages can be only TRUE or FALSE. 
The UNKNOWN logical value in SQL typically occurs in a logical expression 
that involves a NULL. For example, the logical value of each of these 
three expressions is UNKNOWN:

	NULL > 1759;
	NULL = NULL;
	X + NULL > Y

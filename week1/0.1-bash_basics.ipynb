    "## What are Bash & zsh Terminals?\n",
    "Shell terminals, such as Bash and zsh, are text-based user interfaces for interacting with an operating system. They allow you to input commands through a command line, offering direct communication with the system for tasks like file manipulation, program execution, and system control. Bash is common on Linux systems and zsh is the default on MacOS systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions**\n",
    "\n",
    ">The working directory is the directory that commands are executed from. By default, commands will read and write files to this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The root directory is the top of the file system. All other directories are contained within the hierarchy of this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    ">An absolute path starts from the root directory. Think of it like latitude and longitude - the values to a location don't change wherever you are.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A relative path starts from the working directory. Think of it like directions from where you are, like \"20 kilometers West from here\".\n",
    "\n",
    ">A glob pattern is a way of specifying multiple files at once.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A regular expression is a more complex way of specifying text fragments. Learn more in DataCamp's Regular Expressions Cheat Sheet.\n",

    "Welcome back to the wild world of Python programming! In our previous sessions, we've conquered the art of conditional statements and dipped our toes into the magical land of \"for\" loops. Now, it's time to level up and embark on a thrilling journey through the enchanting realm of loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be unraveling the mysteries of the \"while\" statement, mastering the secrets of \"pass,\" \"continue,\" and \"break,\" and depeer exploring the versatile \"for\" loop. We'll learn to dance with strings, groove with lists, synchronize our moves with dictionaries, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "So buckle up, fellow Python adventurer! It's time to dive into the world of loops and embrace the power of iteration. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting your Python voyage, there's something here for everyone. Let's set sail on this coding adventure together! 🐍🌟\n",
    "\n",
    "## The \"while\" statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `while` statement is a powerful tool when you need to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition holds true. Think of it as your trusty sidekick for those dynamic scenarios where you don't know exactly how many iterations you'll need in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use \"while\" Instead of \"for\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a business application, and you want to keep processing customer orders until your inventory is empty or until a specific sales target is met. This is where the \"while\" statement shines. In a business context, you'd use the \"while\" loop when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Conditions:** You have a situation where the number of iterations isn't predetermined. For instance, you're continuously processing customer orders until a specific sales goal is reached, and that goal varies from day to day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-time Monitoring:** You need to monitor a system or process in real-time and take action based on changing conditions. For example, you want to adjust production levels in response to fluctuations in demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interactive User Input:** You're designing an interactive application that waits for user input, such as a chatbot that responds to user messages until the user decides to exit the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"while\" statement allows your program to adapt dynamically to the changing conditions of the real world. It keeps running until a specific condition becomes false, making it ideal for scenarios where flexibility and responsiveness are key.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the \"for\" loop excels in situations where you have a fixed sequence or collection of items to iterate through, the \"while\" loop is your go-to choice when dealing with scenarios that demand dynamic, condition-driven iteration in the ever-changing landscape of business operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. We initialize the principal amount, annual interest rate, and the time period in years. For instance, we start with a principal of $1,000, an annual interest rate of 5%, and a time period of 10 years.\n",

    "   - A is the final amount.\n",
    "   - P is the principal.\n",
    "   - r is the annual interest rate.\n",
    "   - n is the number of times interest is compounded per year.\n",
    "   - t is the time in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We set the compounding frequency (n) to 1, indicating that the interest is compounded annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using a \"while\" loop, we iterate over each year from 1 to the specified number of years. For each year, we calculate the compound interest based on the formula.\n",

    "5. The calculated amount for each year is printed, showing how the investment grows over time.\n",

    "## Pass,  continue & break\n",
    "In Python, we have control flow statements that allow us to manage the flow of our programs. These statements help us make decisions, control loops, and handle various situations. Let's explore three important control flow statements: `pass`, `continue`, and `break`.[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pass:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `pass` statement serves as a placeholder in Python. When you're writing code and need a statement at a certain place but don't want it to perform any action yet, you can use `pass`. It's a way of telling Python, \"I know there should be something here, but I'm not ready to write it yet.\" It's commonly used when you're designing the structure of your code and need to fill in the details later. For example, when defining a function or a class, you might use `pass` until you're ready to write the actual code inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Continue:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `continue` statement is used within loops (like `for` or `while`) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one. Imagine you're iterating over a list of numbers and, when a specific condition is met, you want to skip that number and proceed to the next. You can use `continue` to achieve this. It's like saying, \"I'm done with this part of the loop; let's move to the next element.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Break:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  The `break` statement is also used within loops but is more powerful. When encountered, it immediately exits the loop, even if the loop's conditions are not met. It's like saying, \"I'm done with this loop; let's get out of here.\" You might use `break` when searching for a specific element in a list. Once you find it, you can break the loop instead of continuing to iterate unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "These control flow statements help you manage the flow of your program and make decisions based on conditions, ensuring that your code behaves the way you intend. They are essential tools for any programmer and can simplify complex logic.\n"

    "# Command Line - Managing Files\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn what the file system is and how to manage files and folders through the terminal, using terminal commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, you will learn about the organization of the filesystem on your computer, how to navigate around your filesystem using terminal commands and how to create, remove, and move folders/files using terminal commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File System\n",
    "\n",
    "### FileSystem Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "The files on a Linux or OSX system are arranged in what is called a **hierarchical directory structure**. It means that they are organized in a _tree-like pattern_ of folders (directories), which may contain files and other folders (directories).\n",
    "\n",
    "_When talking about folders, we will use the term directories; these are synonyms and can be used interchangeably_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/lUXvze7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root and Home Directories\n",
    "\n",
    ":::success\n",
    "The top-level directory in the file system is called the **root directory** (`/`).\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Any directory can contain files and/ or subdirectories, which contain more files and subdirectories and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every user has its home directory, where he keeps all the information for his account, including his desktop, movies, pictures, and applications!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open your terminal, you most likely have it waiting for commands in your home directory (`/home/<your_username>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## List Files - `ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "Display a list of files inside the active folder/directory using the `ls` command (_active_ folder means the folder you are currently in). You can also use parameters after `ls` to display more detailed information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see one example: when you open up the command line terminal, you will be starting in a certain location which is usually your home directory (which you can refer to with the symbol `~`). What files and folders exist at this location? Listing them all will allow you to know where you can possibly navigate to. This is where the `ls` command comes in handy. Depending on which location you are currently at, you will see output similar to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "Applications    Documents   Library     Music       Public\n",
    "Desktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can and should use `ls` _a lot_ to see where you are, and what files/folders exist in the current directory before executing commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play with the following commands (you don't have to know all these by heart, but it is good to be aware of their existence):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add `-l` to get a detailed listing:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ ls -l\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add `-t` to sort the results by file time:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ ls -t\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add `-S` to sort by file size:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ ls -S\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add `-r` to reverse the sorting:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ ls -r\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Add `-a` to include hidden files:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ ls -a\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could combine them all to improve your listing. If you type `ls -la`, the result will be the detailed list of files, including the hidden ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the first directories that appear are `.` and `..`, representing the current folder and the parent folder, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working Directory Path\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, you need to know which location you are currently at (a.k.a. the _working directory_). Use the `pwd` command to output the _absolute path_ of the working directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "\n",
    "# /Users/user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute vs. Relative Path\n",
    "\n",
    "An _absolute path_ is the full path of a directory or file in the file system of your machine, which always begins with a `/`. For example, `/Users/user` is the absolute path of a directory, and `/Users/user/.DS_Store` is the absolute path of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _relative path_ is the partial path of a directory or file relative to the working directory. Relative paths do not start with `/`. For example, if the absolute path of your working directory is `/Users/user` and there is a file named `.DS_Store` in the working directory, you can reference the file with `.DS_Store`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "# /Users/user\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ls -l .DS_Store\n",
    "-rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff  10244 Aug 23 11:03 .DS_Store\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use `.` to explicitly reference the current working directory. For instance, `.DS_Store` is equivalent to `./.DS_Store`. And `ls` is equivalent to `ls .`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how to reference the parent directory (directory one level up)? The answer is to use `..`. For example, if your working directory is `/Users/user`, `..` refers to `/Users`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create and Remove Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new folder using the `mkdir <foldername>` command:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ mkdir new-folder\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Remove an empty folder using the `rmdir <foldername>` command:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ rmdir folder-name\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove any folder as long as the folder is empty. If it has files in, you'll have to delete these files before you can remove the folder using `rmdir`. There is a shorter way to do this, we will explain it in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create and remove files\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new, blank file, using `touch <filename>`:\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ touch new-file.fileExtension\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  _fileExtension_ is what characterizes the type of file; if you re creating _html_ file, you would have `new-file.html`, if you are creating a file that will have just some text in it, file extension would be _new-file.txt_, etc.\n",
    "- Remove a file using `rm <filename>`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```shell\n",
    "  $ rm new-file.fileExtension\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a new folder, enter the new folder using cd, and then create several _txt_ files using touch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mkdir my-files\n",
    "$ cd my-files\n",
    "$ touch file-1.txt\n",
    "$ touch file-2.txt\n",
    "$ touch file-3.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-hand would be having all `touch` commands in one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mkdir my-files\n",
    "$ cd my-files\n",
    "$ touch file-1.txt file-2.txt file-3.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you can _combine_ two or more commands in one line, and save some keystrokes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mkdir & cd my-files ==> create directory my-files and enter it\n",
    "$ touch file-1.txt file-2.txt file-3.txt ==> create files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To delete a list of files and folders, including all files from subdirectories, without prompting you for every single entry, you can use the -r option for recursive, and the `-f` option to force it. **If you are one directory above my-files, type**:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::danger\n",
    ":exclamation: **Be careful when deleting a file with `rm -rf`. You can delete _all the files in your Operating System_ if you go to the root of your computer and run the command.**\n",
    "\n",
    ":bangbang: **Alert**: You will not receive any warning or prompt when you use `rm -r` to remove a directory with content. The files and directories removed in the command line will not be recoverable - they will simply disappear on your hard drive skipping the Trash or Recycle Bin. You should exercise caution with this command since you might accidentally delete your entire machine.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ cd ..\n",
    "$ rm -rf my-files\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Display a file\n",
    "\n",
    "You can display the file content in the terminal with the `cat` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ cat <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the specified file is too large, you won't be able to see all the content on the screen. To be able to see all the content page by page, you have to use the `more` or `less` commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ more <filename>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will display the content of a file on the screen and prompt you to scroll through the file a screen at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Copy a file\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `cp` command to copy a file. First, let's create a new file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ touch hello.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the file and add some text. You can use a text editor (VS Code) to add the text and afterward run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ cp hello.txt copied.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this command, a new file (_copied.txt_) has been created, and we can verify that by running `ls` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also copy the file into another directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mkdir copied-files\n",
    "$ cp hello.txt copied-files/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `/` (slash) at the end of a directory. That makes sure the path is a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist, you will get an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now navigate to the `copied-files` folder and run `ls` to make sure the copied file is there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can copy directories that are not empty by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ cp -r\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Move a file\n",
    "\n",
    "You can move a file into a different directory using the `mv` command. Create and enter a new directory called `temp`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mkdir temp\n",
    "$ cd temp\n",
    "$ touch awesome.txt\n",
    "$ ls temp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have just one file called `awesome.txt`. You can **rename** it by moving it into the same folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mv awesome.txt uncool.txt\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should have one file called `uncool.txt`. Move the file into another directory. Instead of specifying a new name for the file, specify a new path:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ mv uncool.txt /Users/my_name/Desktop\n",
    "$ ls /Users/my_name/Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typing the full name is an option, but we want to save those keystrokes, right? You can always use `..` to navigate one level up, `../../` to navigate two levels up, and so on. If we have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Desktop\n",
    "    ├── folder-1\n",
    "    |       └── index.txt\n",
    "    └── folder-2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And we want to move _index.txt_ from the folder-1 to the folder-2, and currently we are in the folder-1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ pwd\n",
    "# ~/Desktop/folder-1\n",
    "\n",
    "$ mv index.txt ../folder-2\n",
    "\n",
    "# exit the folder-1\n",
    "$ cd ..\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "# folder-1 folder-2\n",
    "\n",
    "$ cd folder-2\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "# index.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the file _index.txt_ is now moved to the _folder-2_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to understand the file system and manipulate with it is **super important** to be an efficient developer. Moving files in folders in finder on your Mac is _ok_, but you can become very quick in how you operate if you master the terminal. Practice now as much as possible but don't worry too much - by the end of the course, you will be a pro. :wink:\n",

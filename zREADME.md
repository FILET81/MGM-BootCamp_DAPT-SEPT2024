# Data Analytics Bootcamp - September 2024
This repo will be used to upload the class material. The main branch will contain materials and notebooks without solution. The `class` branch is the one we will use during class. At the end of each class I will merge new things we do in class with the main branch.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions via slack or LinkedIn
